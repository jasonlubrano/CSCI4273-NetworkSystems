 somewhat regretful, and the segment ends. Here, Sinbad’s presence is exploited by Andre as a reaction piece to his inverted antics. There is even a bit of dark play here, as Sinbad has no idea of their intentions. He doesn’t know he is being milked for a reaction.

Dark play also manifests in other guest segments. While some guests appear to be in on the joke, many are not. In season 1, episode 4, model and actress Brandi Glanville appears as a guest, and for a majority of the interview, things are relatively tame. Andre dips his feet in spaghetti, Buress swaps his glasses out every frame, and the questions are risqué, but nothing catastrophic occurs. Then, as Andre asks another question about Glanville’s womb, a muffled voice is heard talking off-screen. While Glanville responds, Andre calls out the one talking, telling him, “[he] can hear him talking the whole fucking interview,” and asks ‘Andrew’ if he can talk to him for a second. “And bend over,” Glanville jokingly says while Andrew approaches the desk. Andre then reaches across the desk and tackles Andrew through it. Glanville jumps from her chair, exclaiming, “oh my god!” and looking worriedly at the camera while Andre berates Andrew and the clip ends. For the majority of the interview, Glanville could be thinking that the show is perhaps in bad taste, but she is in no way expecting things to turn out the way they do. While Andre, Andrew, and Buress can anticipate and interpret what happens, she cannot. For her, there is no humor, only shock. But for the audience, it is her reaction that drives the scene’s humor. She is being purposefully deceived for dramatic and humorous effect.

While these instances illustrate how “The Eric Andre Show” inverts and deconstructs common talk show tropes, there is another way in which Andre depicts his ineptitude for success: his ethnicity. As previously stated, Andre is black and jewish, and he sometimes uses his ethnicity as a means of appropriating humor. In season 1, episode 1, Andre and two unnamed others invade a civil war reenactment, posing as two slaves running from their master. This sketch highlights the often purposefully-neglected memory of slavery in civil war reenactments and other nostalgic pretenses. By using his skin color as an object of humor and posing as a slave, Andre underscores his incompatibility with talk shows while also employing dark play on the participants of the event. They don’t know his motive or that they’re being recorded as the butt of a joke.

Not everyone is openly receptive of this dark play. During an interview with Lauren Conrad, a television personality and fashion designer, Andre vomits on his desk and then begins slurping it back up. In response, Conrad gags and runs off set. During an interview with The Onion’s AV Club, Andre responded: “Her publicist flipped out on us and tried to get us banned all their clients. They called us and said, ‘You can’t air this!’ It was chaos. They were like, ‘He drew a swastika on his face!’ The publicist literally said this: ‘He drew a swastika on his face, and my grandparents died in the Holocaust!’ I’m black and Jewish. Hannibal’s black. My two directors are both Jewish. We’re not exactly the Aryan Nation” (Modell). It’s clear from the quote that Andre has no sensitivity when it comes to his ethnicity or its history, but this quote also underscores another point: nearly everyone involved in the show’s production is jewish. It’s a known entity that much of Hollywood and the entertainment industry is run by jews, and that may have contextual grounds for interpretation, but another aspect of the producer’s Judaism is their assumed knowledge on jewish comedy.

This knowledge is perhaps fully formed in the first season’s fading image. Andre, in a vacant and dimly-lit set, picks up a magic 8-ball and asks it if he’ll ever “make it.” He then shakes the ball as the camera zooms into it and a series of on-the-street interviews play out. In each, someone other than Andre himself asks strangers what they think of the show or Andre. The responses are unanimously negative. They haven’t heard of him, they think the show is boring, or he literally doesn’t exist. While these play, images of Andre weeping on the streets are intercut before the image finally fades to black and a placard appears stating, “R.I.P. Eric Andre. April 4, 1983 - March 10, 2028.” Beyond the surreal mention of Andre’s future death date and the obvious implication that he’s a failure, there is a scathing sense of self-deprecation that seems rooted in jewish tradition. Like Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld before him, Andre depicts himself as a loser, a shlemiel.

There are many facets to the humor of “The Eric Andre Show.” On one hand, everything is easily dismissible as nonsense due to the show’s rampant pace and altered editing. But on the other, Andre’s employment of several humorous techniques and theories to deconstruct the American talk show seem anything but coincidental. From the destruction of the set, to the dark play used to deceive guests, to Andre’s use of ethnicity as both an identification beacon and as material for satire, “The Eric Andre Show” is engineered to critique the moral vacuity rampant in talk shows. Strictly speaking from a rhetorical perspective, Andre’s show is one the most interesting and dense talk shows ever conceived, and judging from the fact that it was recently renewed for a fourth season, audiences seem to agree. There’s no predicting what “The Eric Andre Show” could become, and that’s a part of what makes it special. While others stand stout in their predetermined scripts, Andre makes headway wherever he goes, cutting a path for future post-modern comedians and leaving a trail of pained, confused laughter in his wake. Through its absurdism, use of dark play, and inversion, “The Eric Andre Show” deconstructs the talk show format, morally critiquing the institution for its universal exploitation.
