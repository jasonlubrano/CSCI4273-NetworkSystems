One of the most prolific, self-sustaining, and arguably exploitative genres on television today is the talk show. These are programs dedicated to pushing products, glamorizing celebrities, and maintaining a sense of status quo, all wrapped in the veneer of entertainment news. They’ve been in existence since the dawn of television, and while many newcomers have attempted to bring their personal touch to the genre, talk shows have remained unchanged, and unchallenged, for decades.

Enter Eric Andre. Relatively unknown, Andre got his start in the entertainment industry as a set production assistant on a few episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. From there, he received bit roles in various shows and small films before landing a more permanent role in ABC’s short-lived “Don’t Trust the B in Apartment 23.” While the show didn’t get renewed for a second season and was highly criticized for its polarizing title, it gathered a small following and helped kickstart Andre’s career, leading him to pitch his idea for an original television show to Cartoon Network’s late-night block Adult Swim. The idea? A manic, surreal, anti-talk show known as “The Eric Andre Show.”

The concept first crystalized with Andre himself when he approached show directors Andrew Barchilon and Kitao Sakurai with an idea for the show and a notebook full of “pages and pages of ideas, which were crazy and funny as hell” (FIRST PERSON). What was conceived was “a deconstruction of the late-night talk show format. We’re taking all the classic late-night talk show elements (opening monologue, celebrity guests, desk pieces, man-on-the-street segments) and coming at them with a psychotic, low-budget public access mentality” (FIRST PERSON). It seeks to smash everything normal that talk shows represent, and nowhere is that more evident than in the opening minute of every episode.

The first image is of an unmanned set. There’s a desk with a chair behind it on the right, an armchair on the left, and a hanging decoration in front of gold curtains. A voice announces, “Ladies and gentlemen, it’s the Eric Andre Show!” and the band starts playing just as Andre comes screaming into the frame, leaps off the armchair and through the back curtain. The band continues to play an upbeat, jazzy introduction piece as Andre runs to the band, picks up the drummer’s bass drum, and hurls it across the set. The music continues even as Andre tackles the drummer through the band’s backdrop, during which a production assistant replaces the bass drum with a spare. The next images are sporadic and vary on episode. Usually they involve using various weapons (chainsaws, bats, etc.) to further destroy the set, stunts that clearly cause Andre pain (setting himself on fire and being bitten by dogs), or props used in some bizarre way (chicken carcasses as boxing gloves). By the end of it, Andre is visibly exhausted and plops down on the only piece of furniture left: his chair. The rest of the set is completely destroyed. There are no curtains, there are wood fragments everywhere, and the set’s “EXIT” sign is clearly visible. Andre continues panting, covered in sweat, while a new pair of curtains drop behind him, another desk is rolled out in front of him, and his co-host Hannibal Buress enters.

Beyond being an incredibly energetic, schizophrenic, and destructive way of introducing the show, every opening also cements the show’s, and by proxy, Andre's, rhetorical statement. By literally destroying the set and having it replaced immediately after, many implications about talk shows are made. First, the band’s continued playing during the set’s destruction embodies a hyper-manifested sentiment that “the show must go on.” Nothing, no amount of disaster or danger, can deter the performance, and it speaks to the continued legacy of talk shows. Hosts can retire, interviews can be botched, and entire shows can go under, but the medium will survive. Second, Andre’s rage towards the stone-faced, white-laced normalcy that underlies the talk show circuit is demonstrated. Every blow against his set is a metaphorical attack on the establishment of talk shows. Third, the rapid reconstruction of the set by stagehands implies that a force outside the actual talk show hosts themselves prop up the facade that is the talk show. Whether it be producers, market demands, or the needs of the television audience, forces exterior to the titular hosts maintain the need and supply of talk shows. Finally, it shows how unfit Andre is as a talk show host, thereby implicating the necessities of a “good host.” Andre is both black and jewish, which he refers to as “bluish,” the shows two directors are jewish, and Hannibal is black. None of them fit the normative white-male status that is favored almost universally among mainstream talk shows, and as such, Andre’s reaction to the prescribed space is destructive. He doesn’t fit the mold, so much so that his natural inclination is to destroy it.

But what about the mold of talk shows is so repugnant to Andre? In order to fully explain Andre’s approach and meaning, a brief detour on how talk shows cemented themselves in American television cannon is necessary. This requires two separate, yet interconnected, ideas: that television’s inception and acceptance into the American familial home was aimed at legitimizing and normalizing consumer behavior, and that talk shows create avenues of socioeconomic and political control for advertisers to commodify content and audience.

When television sets were first being introduced to the American public, WW2 had ended and the idea of prosperity seemed alien. Collective memory pointed to the hardships and recession of the 30’s and 40’s as a reason to abstain from active consumerism, which ran contrary to the massive boom the end of the war gave to the U.S. Economy. The result was a population with money to spend and no incentives to spend it. George Lipchitz builds on this point in his text “The Meaning of Memory” when
