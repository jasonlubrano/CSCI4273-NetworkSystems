 he says, “commercial network television played an important role in this emerging economy, functioning as a significant object of consumer purchases as well as an important marketing medium. Sales of sets jumped from three million during the entire decade of the 1940s to over five million a year during the 1950s. But television’s most important economic function came from its role as an instrument of legitimation for transformations in values initiated by the new economic imperatives of postwar America” (Lipchitz 359). He continues, “In addition, FCC decisions to allocate stations on the narrow VHF band, to grant the networks ownership and operation rights over stations in prime markets, and to place a freeze on the licensing of new stations during the important years between 1948 and 1952 all combined to guarantee that advertising-oriented programming based on the model of radio would triumph over theater TV, educational TV, or any other form. Government decisions, not market forces, established the dominance of commercial television” (Lipchitz 360). Postwar Americans, terrified of economic downturn while simultaneously inheriting the monetary benefits of wartime, required persuasion to turn to consumerism, which is exactly what the government and business elites did with television media. This alone should solidify how vital capital is to media and how it informs media’s intentions.

If television in general was designed to institutionalize capitalist consumerism, then talk shows specifically are designed to commodify content and audience. To commodify something is to take its use values— the practical value of something in one’s life— and transform it into exchange values, the dollar value of a product. Thus, commodification inherently removes meaning from product and replaces it with value. This action is nowhere more apparent than in talk shows. Here, there is no differentiation between content, or meaning, and product, or value. The content, whether it be a celebrity interview or political discussion, has no agenda but to serve the product (the celebrity’s movie or a certain political agenda engineered by the show’s executives), so they become indistinguishable. As Christine Quail states in “The Commodification of Talk Show Culture”, “through content commodification and intertextuality, talk shows’ intertextual commodities help blur the boundaries between program and advertisement, as the ads become topics around which shows are structured, such as a celebrity interview with an artist who showcases and distributes to the audience their new album” (Quail 34). This reliance on products to form content completely shatters the need for creativity, as “the creative process is transformed, making room for advertisers earlier in the writing and producing process and opening the door to further commodification. The talk show genre thus becomes more formulaic and restricted, as their reliance on revenues from intertexts limits the types of shows they produce” (Quail 37). It is not the show’s creators who decide content, but the show’s advertisers. If the content is reprehensible, the show cannot market itself to advertisers, and thus loses funding. This link between questionable content and being difficult to sell is the link that connects political economic influence to content control.

On top of this, talk shows also commodify audiences. Quail discusses the importance of talk show audiences when she says, “talk show audiences play an important role as media institutions bind together the audience, media, and advertisers. The reciprocal relationships are such that media sell audiences which perform three key functions for the survival of the system: audiences market goods to themselves, they learn to vote for candidates in the political sphere, and they reaffirm belief in the legitimacy of the politico economic system. Essentially, advertisers buy access to audiences” (Quail 37). Anytime a product is being pushed through a talk show, viewers should know that the financial transaction taking place has them as the item being sold.

From these observations, it’s clear that talk shows have been maintained by advertisers as a means of peddling products, ideology, and political agendas. Beyond being morally objectionable, the conventions of talk shows are ripe for satire, as the subversion of talk show tropes implies the subversion of American consumerism, which has become a growing concern in the information age. Rejection of consumerism is a sentiment gaining momentum on the backs of ludicrous “Black Friday” stories and a cultural emphasis on materialism propagated by corporations and big business. There is a widening gap between consumers and producers, one that is destabilizing the American middle class, and it is in that destabilization that Eric Andre seems to be most comfortable.

It’s difficult to discuss the intricacies of “The Eric Andre Show” without first mentioning how insane it is. It’s telling that each episode is only 11 minutes long and has no advertisements attached to it. Every moment of every episode, from top to bottom, is chaotic, surreal, and almost incomprehensible. This is important because it acts as a double-edged sword that both creates and disavows interpretations. The manic behavior of the show first embodies a sense of Andre’s character and creates avenues to interpret the show’s metaphorical meaning, but more importantly, it illustrates that no matter what interpretations are held, they have the potential to be disproven, or at the very least, made irrelevant. In terms of a metaphysical understanding, this completely eradicates any ability to understand the show’s politics. Any agenda or purpose on the producer’s part is obfuscated with layers of irony and uncertainty, further pushing the show into the nonsense category. Whether there is meaning behind the madness or it is simply done for laughs is still, and will continue to be, up for debate.
