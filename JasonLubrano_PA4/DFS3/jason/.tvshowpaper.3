play out regardless of intention. If something is funny, it is funny for a reason. Theorists continue to debate whether it is the superiority theory or incongruity theory that holds more merit, but E. M. Dadlez argues in “Truly Funny: Humor, Irony, and Satire as Moral Criticism” that, “whichever theoretical position on the objects of humor is ultimately adopted, it remains significant that amusement can depend on the exposure of some previously unconsidered or neglected truth or on the exposure of a moral flaw” (Dadlez 2). Although “The Eric Andre Show” never quite does so explicitly, its subversion of talk show tropes implies an exposure of a neglected truth or moral flaw; in this case, that talk shows are inept and exist merely for the sake of exploitation. Andre exemplifies this notion when he exploits his guests, his crew, and the context of the “talk show” for humor’s, and possibly rhetorical, sake.

In comedy, context reigns supreme. Jokes depend on timing, culture, audience, and an infinite number of other variables. In her same piece, Dadlez states, “comedy is often a performance art, and comedy routines can depend on context for their effectiveness. Further, the context of the presentation can become, for at least some intents and purposes, part of the content of the joke” (Dadlez 5). For Andre, every misstep of the typical talk show script is a purposeful joke, which can be interpreted to interesting rhetorical effect. Through absurdity, trope inversion, and dark play, Andre depicts the talk show industry as a desolate and insane arena of exploitation.

In one surreal moment from season 1, episode 9, Andre and his co-host Hannibal Buress’s conversation is interrupted by a flashing red alarm with the words “Crew Lunch” printed beneath it. Andre then stands from his chair, picks up a presumably heavy bucket from beside the bookshelf, and drags it to the center of the set. Then, as he pours the contents of the bucket (which appear to be macaroni) onto a tarp made of newspaper, a pack of five crew members rush onto the set and begin shoveling the slop into their mouths with their hands. Off-set, another crew member looks on hungrily. This brief moment, which lasts all of 30 seconds, illustrates the industry as impoverish, slave-like, and contradicts the “if you’re on TV, you’re wealthy!” attitude that most talk shows engineer. The crew is apparently exploited for labor and are treated like cattle. Similarly, in season 1, episode 1, Andre is in the middle of introducing a guest when a disembodied voice informs him that “it’s time to play ‘This-or-That’!” While Andre and Buress look off confused, two podiums are rolled out before them, and they reluctantly stand behind them. The voice asks if they are ready, and they both reply “no.” The camera then lingers for a moment before focusing on an image of a Chinese man practicing some sort of body exercise on a hillside. The voice then asks, “Yoga, or Tai Chi?” Andre suggests Tai Chi, and the voice tells him they could not hear him. As a result, a cup of hot coffee is thrown into his face. This exchange of question and coffee into Andre’s face continues, the skit eventually ending when a large, biker-type man slams a hammer through Andre’s hand. Besides the immense physical pain placed on Andre, the disembodied voice dictating the form of the show is a characterization of the forces that control mainstream talk show content. This skit is a subtle nod to a belief in “the powers that be” and their puppeteer control over media. It’s also a clever inversion of the games commonly featured on talk shows.

Another inverted trope Andre utilizes are his notecards. Generally, talk show hosts gather critical information about their guests and localize it on notecards for easy access. In Andre’s perverted world, not only is he inept even with his notecards, but the few glances we get of them are sheer absurdity. In season 1, episode 5, during an interview with Dr. Drew Ordon, who is another talk show host on “The Doctors”, Andre’s notes are shown, one of which is a crudely-drawn NASA rocket flying upwards into a naked, hairy butt, and the other is some sort of big-lipped, pot-bellied naked monkey who holds a boomerang and sports high heels. Needless to say, they’re absurd. The very notion that Andre can somehow gather his notes from these high-school-notebook doodles implies Andre to be a sort of savant, or at least that someone else is writing his notes for him. Either way, this inversion of the popular trope illustrate how absurd Andre and his show are. In the same episode, there is a brief image of a nudist colony before Andre runs through fully clothed in business attire proclaiming, “we’re going reverse-streaking!” These two examples demonstrate the show’s use of inverted context to build humor, arguably exploiting the talk show for its tropes.

Guests also present numerous avenues of exploitation and inversion. In season 1, episode 6, after Sinbad (the real Sinbad) tells a rather licentious tale about how a pimp “hooked him up” with a place to sleep with the caveat that he couldn’t use the room during the day, Andre and Buress joke back and forth about whether or not he cleaned the sheets. Sinbad appears unamused, eventually settling them by telling them that maids cleaned the rooms. Mere moments after, a bell rings, and Andre yells that it’s time for “the wheel of prizes.” From behind the curtain, a spinning wheel is rolled out, with colored segments spelling out prizes such as “Fun Times,” “Big Bucks,” “Move to North Korea,” and “Death.” Andre spins the wheel and he and Buress began chanting “yeah!” as it spins and spins and spins. Just when it appears to be stopping, its momentum is restarted and the two continue chanting. The wheel spins for a full 50 seconds before Sinbad finally stands up and stops the wheel with his hand, accepting “Move to North Korea” as his prize. He then sits down looking distraught,
