2. SERVER
Usage:
$ ./server <port>
Example:
$ ./server 3000

Explination:
Server starts using the example code.
Server waits for a client to send the ready message.
After handshake, server is ready to receive the first command.
Server receive the filename right after.
Server matches the command with the handler.
Commands put, get, delete all require a filename.
ls and exit do not require a filename, but one is sent anyway.
If a nonvalid command is sent, server alerts. (client will already know)
After handling, ready to receive another command and filename.
Upon exit command, server closes the socket.
Program closes.

$ ./client <host> <port>
example:
$ ./client localhost 3000
